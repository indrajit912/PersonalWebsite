                <h2>About the Symposium</h2>
                <p>
                    The Annual Symposium, organized by the Research Scholars at the Stat-Math Unit of the Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore, provides a vibrant platform for academic exchange and collaboration. This event brings together Postdoctoral Fellows (PDFs) and Research Scholars (RSs) to present their ongoing research to an audience comprising professors, fellow researchers, and students.  
                <br>
                    This year, the symposium will span three days, with each speaker allotted a maximum of 45 minutes to share their work. The event also offers a valuable opportunity for Junior Research Fellows (JRFs) in the early stages of their academic journey to showcase their research in a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment.

                    <i>Abstract.</i> Given a finite twisted ideal polygon in \(\mathbb{H}^3\), there exists a harmonic
                    map heat flow \(u_t : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{H}^3\) such that the image of \(u_t\) is asymptotic to that
                    polygon for all \(t \in [0, \infty)\). We extract a sequence \(\hat{u}_n\) such that the image
                    of leaves corresponding to certain quadratic differential under \(\hat{u}_n\) has bounded
                    geodesic curvature and the bound is independent of \(n\). Moreover, if the bound
                    is less than 1, then there exists a sequence \(\hat{u}_n\) which subconverges to a harmonic
                    map \(\hat{u}_\infty : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{H}^3\)  asymptotic to a twisted ideal polygon.

                    <i>Abstract.</i> In their foundational work, Murray and von Neumann studied a specific class of unbounded operators that are, in a precise sense, associated with a given von Neumann algebra. These operators are now referred to as <i>Murray-von Neumann affiliated operators</i>. Their study led to significant structural results concerning the underlying von Neumann algebra. It was later proven that for <i>finite</i> von Neumann algebras, the set of affiliated operators, as defined by Murray and von Neumann, forms a well-structured algebraic object, specifically a topological \(*\)-algebra. However, the algebraic structure of affiliated operators in the general case remains mysterious. In this talk, we introduce a new class of unbounded operators associated with a given von Neumann algebra, which we term <i>affiliated operators</i>. We show that for a von Neumann algebra \(\mathscr{M}\), the set of affiliated operators, denoted \(\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}\), is closed under the operator sum, product, Kaufman inverse, and adjoint operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that \(\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}\) has the structure of a <i>(right) near-semiring</i>. Additionally, we prove that the near-semiring \(\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}\) transforms <i>functorially</i> under normal \(*\)-homomorphisms, establishing it as an intrinsic construction of \(\mathscr{M}\). As a key result, we show that this new notion of affiliation encompasses the classical Murray-von Neumann affiliation. By leveraging the functoriality of \(\mathscr{M}_{\textrm{aff}}\), we also demonstrate that the set of Murray-von Neumann affiliated operators is intrinsic to \(\mathscr{M}\), thus independent of any specific representation.

                    <i>Abstract.</i> The idea of paired operators can be traced back at least to Widom's 1960s work in the context of singular integral equations. In this talk, we will discuss about paired operators     on the Hilbert space \(L^2(\mathbb{T})\) of all Lebesgue square-integrable functions on the unit circle \(\mathbb{T}\). Toeplitz and Hankel operators have different facades and flavors, but the classification       problem of paired operators on \(L^2(\mathbb{T})\) prompted us to investigate Toeplitz + Hankel operators on the Hardy space, and they have also been classified. We will also introduce the notion of inner-        paired operators defined on the classical model spaces and discuss about its classification. This talk is based on a joint work with Nilanjan Das and Jaydeb Sarkar.

                    <i>Abstract.</i> The problem of completing partially specified matrices to positive matrices
                    has been extensively studied due to its theoretical significance and practical applications.
                    In this talk, we address an analogous problem: completing a linear map on \(C^*\)-algebras
                    to a completely positive map. It is shown that whenever such a completion is feasible
                    there exists a unique minimal completion. This theorem is used to show that under
                    some very general conditions a completely positive map almost everywhere equivalent
                    to a quasi-pure map is actually equal to that map. This talk is based on a joint work

                    <i>Abstract.</i> The notions of joint and outer spectral radii are extended to the setting of Hilbert \(C^\ast\)-bimodules. A Rota-Strang type characterisation is proved for the joint spectral          radius. In this general setting, an approximation result for the joint spectral radius in terms of the outer spectral radius has been established.
                    8 This work leads to a new proof of the Wielandt-Friedland's formula for the spectral radius of positive maps. It is observed that algebras generated by tuples of matrices can be determined and their              dimensions can be computed by realizing them as linear span of Choi-Kraus coefficients of some easily computable completely positive maps.

                    <i>Abstract.</i> I will discuss a broader category of risk measures referred to as spectral risk measures, along with their estimation in the context of left truncated and right censored (LTRC) data. LTRC are encountered frequently in insurance loss data due to deductibles and policy limits. Risk estimation is an important task in insurance as it is a necessary step for determining premiums under various policy terms. Spectral risk measures are inherently coherent and have the benefit of connecting the risk measure to the user's risk aversion. We propose a nonparametric estimator of spectral risk measure using the product limit estimator and establish the asymptotic normality for our proposed estimator. We also develop an Edgeworth expansion of our proposed estimator. The bootstrap is employed to approximate the distribution of our proposed estimator and is shown to be second-order accurate. Monte Carlo studies are conducted to compare the proposed spectral risk measure estimator with the existing parametric and nonparametric estimators for left-truncated and right-censored data. Based on our simulation study we estimate the exponential spectral risk measure for two data sets viz; Norwegian fire claims and French marine losses.

                    the study of lemniscates, focusing on geometric and topological properties such as area, length, and the number of connected components of unit lemniscates (\( t = 1 \)) in their 1958 paper
                    [1]. While the maximal length of a lemniscate for a degree-\( n \) polynomial is known to be of the order \( n \), this talk explores the <em>typical length</em> of random polynomial
                    lemniscates. Using an integral geometric formula, we show that for polynomials with i.i.d. roots uniformly distributed in \( \mathbb{D} \), the expected length of their lemniscates is bounded

                    <i>Abstract.</i> Continuous piecewise monotone maps on compact intervals provide simple examples of dynamical systems, however their behavior can be very complex. In fact, even the simplest of such maps, which is piecewise linear and has only one turning point,   can be chaotic in the sense of both Devaney and Li-Yorke, such as the so-called tent map. In this talk we will look at certain invariants for such maps that can help us in classifying them up to topological conjugacy.

                    <i>Abstract.</i> Let \(\mathbb K\) be a field, \(A\) be a matrix in \(M_n(\mathbb K)\), and \(\mathbb L\) be the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial of \(A\). In this talk, we will prove the       existence and uniqueness of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of \(A\), viewed as a matrix in \(M_n(\mathbb L)\), in an elementary computational way. The main strategy is the transformation of \(A\) to an            appropriate block-diagonal form via similarity transformations obtained from Roth's removal rule. Moreover, if \(\mathbb F\) is the fixed field of \(\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb L/ \mathbb K)\) then the potentially-        diagonalizable and nilpotent parts of \(A\) are both in \(M_n(\mathbb F)\); in particular, when \(\mathbb K\) is a perfect field, they are both in \(M_n(\mathbb K)\). With the block-diagonal form of \(A\) in hand, by     appropriately using Roth's removal rule in the context of strictly upper-triangular matrices, we will arrive at the Jordan canonical form of \(A\).

                    <i>Abstract.</i> In this talk, we shall discuss the classification of bounded operators that are products of two orthogonal projections on a Hilbert space. Our results complement some of the          classical results of Crimmins and von Neumann. We also characterize the products of two inner projections defined on the Hardy space over the unit polydisc. This talk is based on a joint work with Jaydeb        Sarkar.

                    <i>Abstract.</i> Let \(\mathcal{H}\) be a separable Hilbert space. A one-parameter \(E_0\)-semigroup \(\{\alpha_t\}_{t \geq 0}\) is a family of unital, normal, \(*\)-endomorphisms of \(B(\mathcal{H})\)         that obey the semigroup property, along with some continuity conditions. \(E_0\)-semigroups can be classified into three types depending upon the "abundance" of units and whether the said units generate the       associated product system. One-parameter \(E_0\)-semigroups have been studied extensively by Powers, Arveson and other authors, and Arveson showed in his works that a one-parameter \(E_0\)-semigroup is a CCR        flow if and only if it has units and is type I. He also introduced a numerical invariant, called the index, which provides an estimate about the number of units of an \(E_0\)-semigroup.

                    9 In this talk, I shall give a brief introduction to multi-parameter \(E_0\)-semigroups, focusing on CCR flows over closed convex cones in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), briefly touching on the differences between the one-        parameter and multi-parameter theory. I shall also define Induced Isometric Representations, where we "induce" isometric representations from discrete semigroups onto continuous ones, and explain how these      help with achieving uncountably many examples of <i>prime</i> type I CCR flows with index \(k\), for any \(k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}\).

                    <i>Abstract.</i> In this talk, we shall describe all the invariant subspaces of a completely nonunitary contraction \(T_c\) with nonzero scalar constant characteristic function \(c\), where \(|c|\lt 1 \). Moreover, we show that \(T_c\) and the restriction to its invariant subspaces are essentially normal. Using this description of \(T_c\)-invariant subspaces, we then identify the hyperinvariant subspaces.

                    <i>Abstract.</i> A function \(f\) on the real line is called an operator Lipschitz function if
                    \[
                        \|f(A)-f(B)\|\le \text{const} \, \|A-B\|
                    \]
                    for arbitrary self-adjoint operators \(A\) and \(B\).
                    
                    Not all Lipschitz functions are operator Lipschitz. For example, the function \(|x|\) is not operator Lipschitz.
                    The class of operator Lipschitz functions plays an important role in perturbation theory.
                    I am going to give necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for a function to be operator Lipschitz. 
                    Similarly, one can define operator Lipschitz functions on the circle and on subsets of the complex plane.
